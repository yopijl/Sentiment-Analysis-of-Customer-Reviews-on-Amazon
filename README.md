# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews on Amazon
In this project, I used Python to develop a natural language processing system that implements a sentiment analysis classifier using two main approaches: NLTK's VADER and Roberta Transformers' Huggingface.

The goal of this project is to classify the sentiment of Amazon customer reviews and to compare the performance between the models developed using these two packages. By comparing the results of both approaches, we can gain a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

Sentiment analysis plays an important role in language modeling and can provide valuable insights to data scientists in understanding users' perceptions of a particular product or service. Through this project, I hope to make a useful contribution to the development of more sophisticated and accurate sentiment analysis techniques.
